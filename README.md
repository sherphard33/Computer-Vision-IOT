##Light up that Jollie fatman

This is code for deploying an image detetion model trained using Keras onto a raspberrypi 3B controlling a pan-tilt Gun Turret. 
The script uses Opencv to draw bounding boxes around the target and label it, a Gun.wav file is played when the gun has been moved from rest position to shoot position.

You can train your own model and change the image size dimensions to suit your input image size.
